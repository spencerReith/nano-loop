# 4077. Minimize Inversions in a Prefix Tree (Hard)

You are given an array `words` of `n` **unique** strings containing only lowercase English letters from `'a'` to `'j'`. You are also given an integer array `target` containing each index from 0 to `n - 1` exactly once.

Build a **prefix tree** from `words`:

* The root represents the empty string `""`.
* Each other node represents a different non-empty prefix of a word. The parent of a node is the prefix obtained by removing its last character.
* The node representing the complete word `words[i]` is marked with index `i`. A marked node may also have children.

You may choose the order of the children of **each node independently**. You cannot change which node is a child's parent.

Traverse the tree starting at the root. When visiting a node, first record its index if it is marked. Then visit its children in the chosen order, completing the traversal of each child before moving to the next. This is a **pre-order traversal**.

The recorded indices form an array `traversal` of length `n`. Let `pos[i]` be the position of index `i` in `target`.

An **inversion** is a pair of positions `(a, b)` such that `0 <= a < b < n` and `pos[traversal[a]] > pos[traversal[b]]`.

Return the **minimum possible number of inversions** over all choices of child orderings.

**Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2026/03/04/screenshot-2026-03-04-at-55332pm.png)​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

**Input:** words = ["bad","bag","fig","fed"], target = [3,1,0,2]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

Visit the root's `"f"` child before its `"b"` child. Within the `"f"` branch, visit `"fed"` before `"fig"`. Within the `"b"` branch, visit `"bag"` before `"bad"`.

This produces `traversal = [3,2,1,0]`:

| Traversal position | Word index | Word | Position in target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 3 | `"fed"` | 0 |
| 1 | 2 | `"fig"` | 3 |
| 2 | 1 | `"bag"` | 1 |
| 3 | 0 | `"bad"` | 2 |

The positions in `target` are `[0,3,1,2]`. The inversions are the pairs of **traversal positions** `(1,2)` and `(1,3)`, since `3 > 1` and `3 > 2`.

No child ordering produces fewer than 2 inversions.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = ["ab","ac","ba","bc"], target = [0,3,1,2]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

Visit the root's `"a"` child before its `"b"` child. Within these branches, visit `"ab"` before `"ac"`, and `"bc"` before `"ba"`.

This produces `traversal = [0,1,3,2]`:

| Traversal position | Word index | Word | Position in target |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | `"ab"` | 0 |
| 1 | 1 | `"ac"` | 2 |
| 2 | 3 | `"bc"` | 1 |
| 3 | 2 | `"ba"` | 3 |

The positions in `target` are `[0,2,1,3]`. The only inversion is the pair of **traversal positions** `(1,2)`, since `2 > 1`.

No child ordering produces zero inversions.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n == words.length <= 10^4`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
* `words[i]` contains only lowercase English letters from `'a'` to `'j'`​​​​​​​
* All `words[i]` are **unique**
* `0 <= target[i] <= n - 1`
* `target` is a permutation of integers from 0 to `n - 1`

**Time limit:** 7s

    def minInversions(self, words: list[str], target: list[int]) -> int:
