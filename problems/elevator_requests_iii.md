# 4027. Elevator Requests III (Hard)

You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of floors in a building, where the floors are numbered from 0 to `n - 1`.

You are also given an integer `start` and a 2D integer array `requests`, where `requests[i] = [arrival_i, floor_i]` indicates that a request for `floor_i` is made at time `arrival_i`.

At time 0, the elevator is at floor `start`.

At each second, the elevator may move **up** by 1 floor, move **down** by 1 floor, or **remain** on its current floor.

A request can be fulfilled **only** at or after its arrival time; it is fulfilled **instantly** when the elevator is on its requested floor at any time from its arrival time onward.

Return the **minimum** time needed to fulfill all requests.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 9, start = 0, requests = [[0,8],[6,5]]

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:**

* Move from floor 0 (`start`) to floor 5 (`requests[1][1]`) in 5 seconds, reaching at time 5. Since `requests[1][0] = 6`, wait until time 6 to fulfill it.
* Move from floor 5 to floor 8 (`requests[0][1]`) in 3 seconds, fulfilling it at time 9.

Thus, all requests are fulfilled by time 9.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 8, start = 5, requests = [[1,7],[7,3]]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

* Move from floor 5 (`start`) to floor 7 (`requests[0][1]`) in 2 seconds, reaching at time 2. Since `requests[0][0] = 1` has already passed, floor 7 is fulfilled at time 2.
* Move from floor 7 to floor 3 (`requests[1][1]`) in 4 seconds, reaching at time 6. Since `requests[1][0] = 7`, wait until time 7.

Thus, all requests are fulfilled by time 7.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 7, start = 3, requests = [[0,5],[0,1],[6,3]]

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:**

* Move from floor 3 (`start`) to floor 5 (`requests[0][1]`) in 2 seconds, fulfilling it at time 2.
* Move from floor 5 to floor 1 (`requests[1][1]`) in 4 seconds, fulfilling it at time 6.
* Move from floor 1 to floor 3 (`requests[2][1]`) in 2 seconds, reaching at time 8. Its request arrived at `requests[2][0] = 6`, so floor 3 is fulfilled at time 8.

Thus, all requests are fulfilled by time 8.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^9`
* `1 <= requests.length <= 16`
* `requests[i] == [arrival_i, floor_i]`
* `0 <= arrival_i <= 10^9`
* `0 <= start, floor_i <= n - 1`

**Time limit:** 10s
