# 4081. Prime Subset Selection II (Hard)

You are given two integers `n` and `s`.

Consider all **prime** numbers less than or equal to `n`. Select a **subset** of these primes such that:

* Each prime can be selected **at most once**.
* The **sum** of the selected primes is as **large** as possible while remaining **less than or equal** to `s`.
* Among subsets with the **maximum** sum, select one containing the **fewest** primes.
* If multiple subsets remain tied, select the one whose elements, written in increasing order, form the **lexicographically smallest** array.

Return an integer array containing the selected primes in **increasing** order. If no valid **non-empty** subset exists, return an empty array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 7, s = 20

**Output:** [2, 3, 5, 7]

**Explanation:**

* The prime numbers less than or equal to `n = 7` are 2, 3, 5, and 7.
* The sum of all these primes is `2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17`, which is less than or equal to `s = 20`.
* Thus, the answer is `[2, 3, 5, 7]`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 15, s = 18

**Output:** [5,13]

**Explanation:**

* The prime numbers less than or equal to 15 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.
* The subsets with sum 18 are `[5, 13]`, `[7, 11]`, `[2, 3, 13]`, and `[2, 5, 11]`. Since this sum equals `s`, it is the maximum possible sum.
* Among these subsets, `[5, 13]` and `[7, 11]` contain the fewest primes: two.
* Between these two subsets, `[5, 13]` is lexicographically smaller because its first element, 5, is smaller than 7. Thus, the answer is `[5, 13]`.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 5, s = 1

**Output:** []

**Explanation:**

* The smallest prime number is 2, which is greater than `s = 1`.
* Thus, no prime can be selected, so the answer is an empty array.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 1000`
* `1 <= s <= 1000`

**Time limit:** 2s
