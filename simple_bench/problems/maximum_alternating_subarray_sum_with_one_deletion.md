# 4072. Maximum Alternating Subarray Sum With One Deletion (Medium)

You are given an integer array `nums`.

You may delete **at most one** element from `nums`, then choose a **subarray** of the resulting array.

Return the **maximum** possible **alternating sum** of the chosen subarray.

The **alternating sum** of an array is the sum of its elements at even indices minus the sum of its elements at odd indices. The chosen subarray is **reindexed starting from 0** before calculating its alternating sum.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [5,-5,1]

**Output:** 11

**Explanation:**

Choose not to delete an element and select the entire array. Its alternating sum is `5 - (-5) + 1 = 11`, which is the maximum possible.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [10,-5,-100]

**Output:** 110

**Explanation:**

Delete `nums[1] = -5` to obtain `[10,-100]`, then select the entire resulting array. Its alternating sum is `10 - (-100) = 110`, which is the maximum possible.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [4,7]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

Choose not to delete an element and select the subarray `[7]`. Its alternating sum is 7, which is the maximum possible.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

**Time limit:** 2s
